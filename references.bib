abstract="We provide approximation algorithms for several variants of the Firefighter problem on general graphs. The Firefighter problem models the case where an infection or another diffusive process (such as an idea, a computer virus, or a fire) is spreading through a network, and our goal is to stop this infection by using targeted vaccinations. Specifically, we are allowed to vaccinate at most B nodes per time-step (for some budget B), with the goal of minimizing the effect of the infection. The difficulty of this problem comes from its temporal component, since we must choose nodes to vaccinate at every time-step while the infection is spreading through the network, leading to notions of ``cuts over time''.",
